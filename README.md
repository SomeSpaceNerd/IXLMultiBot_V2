# Why is This Important?
This is important because this is one of the first function IXL Bot there is, now updated to the most recent version of Selenium with more/better features and constant support.


# What can it do

it can:
scrape questions and answers 
generate teacher accounts
inflate your time! (get over 10 hours w/o doing anything)
auto answer!

# How Does it Work?
Works by using an automation tool called Selenium, in python.

# How do I download it?

1. First of all make sure you have python 3 installed, if you dont google how to download it.
2. Then, while in the directory containing the files, run this command pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Update your chrome browser to the most recent version
4. Download and install the chromedriver for your OS from here https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable
5. Run the program
6. Profit?

# Is this a Virus?
No this is not a virus. It is open source so you can check the code. 

# What works?
Still in development but only option 1 and 2 work. 
i have 3 done, you can try running it but you will get errors, i am still fixing that part of the code.
Same with the scraper, it only works with some questions until i add new Xpaths but i am too tired to do it today, so it expect it in a couple days.

# INFO
this code uses over 300 lines of code and was coded in all one day, so please expect some errors along the way.
If you want to report errors, make an issue, if you know python yourself, fix the error and make a pull request.
